# Hi there, I'm Elisa! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's student in Financial Risk and Data Analysis at Sapienza University of Rome.  
Iâ€™m passionate about quantitative finance, data analysis, and programming.

This is where I share my university projects, research work, and personal experiments on topics I find exciting.

Feel free to explore my repositories! Iâ€™m always eager to learn and collaborate :))
